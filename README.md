# CharityAF (By sudo hackers)

**demo:  https://charitybh-dc293.web.app/

**Building awareness of charities in need of funds just got better!!! The project is a collection of a cool website that connects charities with popular websites willing to donate their web traffic for a good cause and a beautiful overlay template that redirects the user to the charity's website for donations.** 



## Working Principle

* Charities with option for online donation are the target end users of our website.
* The website is a single page scroll down site with the following componenets:
  * The first look is a brief description of what the site does.
  * Scrolling down we get the list of charities already enrolled with us.
  * In the end, we see a form for any interested charity to enroll with us.
* The charity can visit the website to enroll their charity in the list of charities that get linked with popular sites.
* The list of charities are verified by us - the admins - with some background checking that involves Google searches and/or contacting the charity for direct verification.
* The verified charities get added to our list of charities get featured as overlays in frequently visited sites which are willing to donate their web traffic for the cause.
* The users of that website can read up on the charity description and can do either of the following:
  * Choose to opt in for donation in which case they can click the donate button which redireccts them to the site of the charity or the payment gateway for the charity.
  * Choose to opt out of donation in which case they can click the X on the top right of the overlay and continue browsing in the website.
